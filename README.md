# ReactorCore-1.21.1

A Minecraft 1.21.1 mod adding nuclear energy mechanics, including reactors, fuels, and safety tools.

## Development Status
I'm currently working on it to make the mod playable with basic nuclear functionality.
The focus is on a simple fission reactor system: mining resources → crafting fuel → assembling a small reactor → generating power (Forge Energy/FE) → handling waste and radiation.

#### Items (4 in total):
1. **Raw Uranium**:
-  Crushed from ore. smelts it into uranium ingots.
  
2. **Uranium Ingot**:
-  smelted from ore. Intermediate crafting material, used to make fuel rods

3. **Empty Fuel Rod**: 
-  Crafted from iron ingots. Intermediate crafting material, used to make fuel rods
  
4. **Uranium Fuel Rod**:
-  Crafted from ingots with Empty Fuel Rod. inserted into reactor to generate heat or energy.

#### Blocks (3 in total):
1. **Uranium Ore**:
-  Mined underground. Spawns in overworld like gold, mined them turn into raw uranium.
  
2. **Reactor Frame** :
-  iron-based blocks forming the reactor's outer shell.

3. **Reactor Core**:
-  Central controller block.

### machine
- **Small Reactor**:
  -  Assembly: Build 3x3x3 structure with frames around internals; auto-detects formation.
  -  Operation: Insert fuel; reactor produces power
  
### **Next Steps**
- Haven't decided yet!!
